Phylogenetic validation
In this section, you'll discover the raw code employed in generating the input data for Pairtree on an slurm-based HPC. Additionally, we provide the code for extracting barcodes from 10X-linked reads, essential for phylogenetic validation. Explore these scripts to gain insights into our methodologies and reproduce our results efficiently.
